## Exercise 1&Exercise 2(Group 86)

We implement Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz algorithm in lab1 and Singhalâ€™s algorithm in lab2

### How to run our code?

First compile the program, remember the main function is in mainframe.java. Your can set process number and running mode in by using  command line parameters.  (For example, [Former command] 5 auto means running program with 5 processes in auto mode).

Our program including 2 running mode, including testing mode and auto mode. For testing mode, we prepare some testing cases in advance and you can test the correctness of our program by running testing mode. For auto mode, every process in the program will automatically send message (or request) to other processes. This mode is mainly for proving that our program is functionable.
